  /**
   * Use the dnd-draggable attribute to make your element draggable
   *
   * Attributes:
   * - dnd-draggable      Required attribute. The value has to be an object that represents the data
   *                      of the element. In case of a drag and drop operation the object will be
   *                      serialized and unserialized on the receiving end.
   * - dnd-effect-allowed Use this attribute to limit the operations that can be performed. Valid
   *                      options are "move", "copy" and "link", as well as "all", "copyMove",
   *                      "copyLink" and "linkMove". The semantics of these operations are up to you
   *                      and have to be implemented using the callbacks described below. If you
   *                      allow multiple options, the user can choose between them by using the
   *                      modifier keys (OS specific). The cursor will be changed accordingly,
   *                      expect for IE and Edge, where this is not supported.
   * - dnd-type           Use this attribute if you have different kinds of items in your
   *                      application and you want to limit which items can be dropped into which
   *                      lists. Combine with dnd-allowed-types on the dnd-list(s). This attribute
   *                      must be a lower case string. Upper case characters can be used, but will
   *                      be converted to lower case automatically.
   * - dnd-disable-if     You can use this attribute to dynamically disable the draggability of the
   *                      element. This is useful if you have certain list items that you don't want
   *                      to be draggable, or if you want to disable drag & drop completely without
   *                      having two different code branches (e.g. only allow for admins).
   *
   * Callbacks:
   * - dnd-dragstart      Callback that is invoked when the element was dragged. The original
   *                      dragstart event will be provided in the local event variable.
   * - dnd-moved          Callback that is invoked when the element was moved. Usually you will
   *                      remove your element from the original list in this callback, since the
   *                      directive is not doing that for you automatically. The original dragend
   *                      event will be provided in the local event variable.
   * - dnd-copied         Same as dnd-moved, just that it is called when the element was copied
   *                      instead of moved, so you probably want to implement a different logic.
   * - dnd-linked         Same as dnd-moved, just that it is called when the element was linked
   *                      instead of moved, so you probably want to implement a different logic.
   * - dnd-canceled       Callback that is invoked if the element was dragged, but the operation was
   *                      canceled and the element was not dropped. The original dragend event will
   *                      be provided in the local event variable.
   * - dnd-dragend        Callback that is invoked when the drag operation ended. Available local
   *                      variables are event and dropEffect.
   * - dnd-selected       Callback that is invoked when the element was clicked but not dragged.
   *                      The original click event will be provided in the local event variable.
   * - dnd-callback       Custom callback that is passed to dropzone callbacks and can be used to
   *                      communicate between source and target scopes. The dropzone can pass user
   *                      defined variables to this callback.
   *
   * CSS classes:
   * - dndDragging        This class will be added to the element while the element is being
   *                      dragged. It will affect both the element you see while dragging and the
   *                      source element that stays at it's position. Do not try to hide the source
   *                      element with this class, because that will abort the drag operation.
   * - dndDraggingSource  This class will be added to the element after the drag operation was
   *                      started, meaning it only affects the original element that is still at
   *                      it's source position, and not the "element" that the user is dragging with
   *                      his mouse pointer.

  /**
   * Use the dnd-list attribute to make your list element a dropzone. Usually you will add a single
   * li element as child with the ng-repeat directive. If you don't do that, we will not be able to
   * position the dropped element correctly. If you want your list to be sortable, also add the
   * dnd-draggable directive to your li element(s).
   *
   * Attributes:
   * - dnd-list             Required attribute. The value has to be the array in which the data of
   *                        the dropped element should be inserted. The value can be blank if used
   *                        with a custom dnd-drop handler that always returns true.
   * - dnd-allowed-types    Optional array of allowed item types. When used, only items that had a
   *                        matching dnd-type attribute will be dropable. Upper case characters will
   *                        automatically be converted to lower case.
   * - dnd-effect-allowed   Optional string expression that limits the drop effects that can be
   *                        performed in the list. See dnd-effect-allowed on dnd-draggable for more
   *                        details on allowed options. The default value is all.
   * - dnd-disable-if       Optional boolean expresssion. When it evaluates to true, no dropping
   *                        into the list is possible. Note that this also disables rearranging
   *                        items inside the list.
   * - dnd-horizontal-list  Optional boolean expresssion. When it evaluates to true, the positioning
   *                        algorithm will use the left and right halfs of the list items instead of
   *                        the upper and lower halfs.
   * - dnd-external-sources Optional boolean expression. When it evaluates to true, the list accepts
   *                        drops from sources outside of the current browser tab. This allows to
   *                        drag and drop accross different browser tabs. The only major browser
   *                        that does not support this is currently Microsoft Edge.
   *
   * Callbacks:
   * - dnd-dragover         Optional expression that is invoked when an element is dragged over the
   *                        list. If the expression is set, but does not return true, the element is
   *                        not allowed to be dropped. The following variables will be available:
   *                        - event: The original dragover event sent by the browser.
   *                        - index: The position in the list at which the element would be dropped.
   *                        - type: The dnd-type set on the dnd-draggable, or undefined if non was
   *                          set. Will be null for drops from external sources in IE and Edge,
   *                          since we don't know the type in those cases.
   *                        - dropEffect: One of move, copy or link, see dnd-effect-allowed.
   *                        - external: Whether the element was dragged from an external source.
   *                        - callback: If dnd-callback was set on the source element, this is a
   *                          function reference to the callback. The callback can be invoked with
   *                          custom variables like this: callback({var1: value1, var2: value2}).
   *                          The callback will be executed on the scope of the source element. If
   *                          dnd-external-sources was set and external is true, this callback will
   *                          not be available.
   * - dnd-drop             Optional expression that is invoked when an element is dropped on the
   *                        list. The same variables as for dnd-dragover will be available, with the
   *                        exception that type is always known and therefore never null. There
   *                        will also be an item variable, which is the transferred object. The
   *                        return value determines the further handling of the drop:
   *                        - falsy: The drop will be canceled and the element won't be inserted.
   *                        - true: Signalises that the drop is allowed, but the dnd-drop
   *                          callback already took care of inserting the element.
   *                        - otherwise: All other return values will be treated as the object to
   *                          insert into the array. In most cases you want to simply return the
   *                          item parameter, but there are no restrictions on what you can return.
   * - dnd-inserted         Optional expression that is invoked after a drop if the element was
   *                        actually inserted into the list. The same local variables as for
   *                        dnd-drop will be available. Note that for reorderings inside the same
   *                        list the old element will still be in the list due to the fact that
   *                        dnd-moved was not called yet.
   *
   * CSS classes:
   * - dndPlaceholder       When an element is dragged over the list, a new placeholder child
   *                        element will be added. This element is of type li and has the class
   *                        dndPlaceholder set. Alternatively, you can define your own placeholder
   *                        by creating a child element with dndPlaceholder class.
   * - dndDragover          Will be added to the list while an element is dragged over the list.

 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name tagsInput
 * @module ngTagsInput
 *
 * @description
 * Renders an input box with tag editing support.
 *
 * @param {string} ngModel Assignable Angular expression to data-bind to.
 * @param {string=} [template=NA] URL or id of a custom template for rendering each tag.
 * @param {string=} [templateScope=NA] Scope to be passed to custom templates - of both tagsInput and
 *    autoComplete directives - as $scope.
 * @param {string=} [displayProperty=text] Property to be rendered as the tag label.
 * @param {string=} [keyProperty=text] Property to be used as a unique identifier for the tag.
 * @param {string=} [type=text] Type of the input element. Only 'text', 'email' and 'url' are supported values.
 * @param {string=} [text=NA] Assignable Angular expression for data-binding to the element's text.
 * @param {number=} tabindex Tab order of the control.
 * @param {string=} [placeholder=Add a tag] Placeholder text for the control.
 * @param {number=} [minLength=3] Minimum length for a new tag.
 * @param {number=} [maxLength=MAX_SAFE_INTEGER] Maximum length allowed for a new tag.
 * @param {number=} [minTags=0] Sets minTags validation error key if the number of tags added is less than minTags.
 * @param {number=} [maxTags=MAX_SAFE_INTEGER] Sets maxTags validation error key if the number of tags added is greater
 *    than maxTags.
 * @param {boolean=} [allowLeftoverText=false] Sets leftoverText validation error key if there is any leftover text in
 *    the input element when the directive loses focus.
 * @param {string=} [removeTagSymbol=×] (Obsolete) Symbol character for the remove tag button.
 * @param {boolean=} [addOnEnter=true] Flag indicating that a new tag will be added on pressing the ENTER key.
 * @param {boolean=} [addOnSpace=false] Flag indicating that a new tag will be added on pressing the SPACE key.
 * @param {boolean=} [addOnComma=true] Flag indicating that a new tag will be added on pressing the COMMA key.
 * @param {boolean=} [addOnBlur=true] Flag indicating that a new tag will be added when the input field loses focus.
 * @param {boolean=} [addOnPaste=false] Flag indicating that the text pasted into the input field will be split into tags.
 * @param {string=} [pasteSplitPattern=,] Regular expression used to split the pasted text into tags.
 * @param {boolean=} [replaceSpacesWithDashes=true] Flag indicating that spaces will be replaced with dashes.
 * @param {string=} [allowedTagsPattern=.+] Regular expression that determines whether a new tag is valid.
 * @param {boolean=} [enableEditingLastTag=false] Flag indicating that the last tag will be moved back into the new tag
 *    input box instead of being removed when the backspace key is pressed and the input box is empty.
 * @param {boolean=} [addFromAutocompleteOnly=false] Flag indicating that only tags coming from the autocomplete list
 *    will be allowed. When this flag is true, addOnEnter, addOnComma, addOnSpace and addOnBlur values are ignored.
 * @param {boolean=} [spellcheck=true] Flag indicating whether the browser's spellcheck is enabled for the input field or not.
 * @param {expression=} [tagClass=NA] Expression to evaluate for each existing tag in order to get the CSS classes to be used.
 *    The expression is provided with the current tag as $tag, its index as $index and its state as $selected. The result
 *    of the evaluation must be one of the values supported by the ngClass directive (either a string, an array or an object).
 *    See https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngClass for more information.
 * @param {expression=} [onTagAdding=NA] Expression to evaluate that will be invoked before adding a new tag. The new
 *    tag is available as $tag. This method must return either a boolean value or a promise. If either a false value or a rejected
 *    promise is returned, the tag will not be added.
 * @param {expression=} [onTagAdded=NA] Expression to evaluate upon adding a new tag. The new tag is available as $tag.
 * @param {expression=} [onInvalidTag=NA] Expression to evaluate when a tag is invalid. The invalid tag is available as $tag.
 * @param {expression=} [onTagRemoving=NA] Expression to evaluate that will be invoked before removing a tag. The tag
 *    is available as $tag. This method must return either a boolean value or a promise. If either a false value or a rejected
 *    promise is returned, the tag will not be removed.
 * @param {expression=} [onTagRemoved=NA] Expression to evaluate upon removing an existing tag. The removed tag is available as $tag.
 * @param {expression=} [onTagClicked=NA] Expression to evaluate upon clicking an existing tag. The clicked tag is available as $tag.

 * @param {number=} [minLength=3] Minimum number of characters that must be entered before evaluating the expression
 *    in the source option.
 * @param {boolean=} [highlightMatchedText=true] Flag indicating that the matched text will be highlighted in the
 *    suggestions list.
 * @param {number=} [maxResultsToShow=10] Maximum number of results to be displayed at a time.
 * @param {boolean=} [loadOnDownArrow=false] Flag indicating that the source option will be evaluated when the down arrow
 *    key is pressed and the suggestion list is closed. The current input value is available as $query.
 * @param {boolean=} [loadOnEmpty=false] Flag indicating that the source option will be evaluated when the input content
 *    becomes empty. The $query variable will be passed to the expression as an empty string.
 * @param {boolean=} [loadOnFocus=false] Flag indicating that the source option will be evaluated when the input element

   * @ngdoc function
   * @name ui.router.util.$resolve#resolve
   * @methodOf ui.router.util.$resolve
   *
   * @description
   * Resolves a set of invocables. An invocable is a function to be invoked via 
   * `$injector.invoke()`, and can have an arbitrary number of dependencies. 
   * An invocable can either return a value directly,
   * or a `$q` promise. If a promise is returned it will be resolved and the 
   * resulting value will be used instead. Dependencies of invocables are resolved 
   * (in this order of precedence)
   *
   * - from the specified `locals`
   * - from another invocable that is part of this `$resolve` call
   * - from an invocable that is inherited from a `parent` call to `$resolve` 
   *   (or recursively
   * - from any ancestor `$resolve` of that parent).
   *
   * The return value of `$resolve` is a promise for an object that contains 
   * (in this order of precedence)
   *
   * - any `locals` (if specified)
   * - the resolved return values of all injectables
   * - any values inherited from a `parent` call to `$resolve` (if specified)
   *
   * The promise will resolve after the `parent` promise (if any) and all promises 
   * returned by injectables have been resolved. If any invocable 
   * (or `$injector.invoke`) throws an exception, or if a promise returned by an 
   * invocable is rejected, the `$resolve` promise is immediately rejected with the 
   * same error. A rejection of a `parent` promise (if specified) will likewise be 
   * propagated immediately. Once the `$resolve` promise has been rejected, no 
   * further invocables will be called.
   * 
   * Cyclic dependencies between invocables are not permitted and will cause `$resolve`
   * to throw an error. As a special case, an injectable can depend on a parameter 
   * with the same name as the injectable, which will be fulfilled from the `parent` 
   * injectable of the same name. This allows inherited values to be decorated. 
   * Note that in this case any other injectable in the same `$resolve` with the same
   * dependency would see the decorated value, not the inherited value.
   *
   * Note that missing dependencies -- unlike cyclic dependencies -- will cause an 
   * (asynchronous) rejection of the `$resolve` promise rather than a (synchronous) 
   * exception.
   *
   * Invocables are invoked eagerly as soon as all dependencies are available. 
   * This is true even for dependencies inherited from a `parent` call to `$resolve`.
   *
   * As a special case, an invocable can be a string, in which case it is taken to 
   * be a service name to be passed to `$injector.get()`. This is supported primarily 
   * for backwards-compatibility with the `resolve` property of `$routeProvider` 
   * routes.
   *
   * @param {object} invocables functions to invoke or 
   * `$injector` services to fetch.
   * @param {object} locals  values to make available to the injectables
   * @param {object} parent  a promise returned by another call to `$resolve`.
   * @param {object} self  the `this` for the invoked methods
   * @return {object} Promise for an object that contains the resolved return value
   * of all invocables, as well as any inherited and local values.

/**
 * @ngdoc object
 * @name ui.router.util.type:UrlMatcher
 *
 * @description
 * Matches URLs against patterns and extracts named parameters from the path or the search
 * part of the URL. A URL pattern consists of a path pattern, optionally followed by '?' and a list
 * of search parameters. Multiple search parameter names are separated by '&'. Search parameters
 * do not influence whether or not a URL is matched, but their values are passed through into
 * the matched parameters returned by {@link ui.router.util.type:UrlMatcher#methods_exec exec}.
 *
 * Path parameter placeholders can be specified using simple colon/catch-all syntax or curly brace
 * syntax, which optionally allows a regular expression for the parameter to be specified:
 *
 * * `':'` name - colon placeholder
 * * `'*'` name - catch-all placeholder
 * * `'{' name '}'` - curly placeholder
 * * `'{' name ':' regexp|type '}'` - curly placeholder with regexp or type name. Should the
 *   regexp itself contain curly braces, they must be in matched pairs or escaped with a backslash.
 *
 * Parameter names may contain only word characters (latin letters, digits, and underscore) and
 * must be unique within the pattern (across both path and search parameters). For colon
 * placeholders or curly placeholders without an explicit regexp, a path parameter matches any
 * number of characters other than '/'. For catch-all placeholders the path parameter matches
 * any number of characters.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * * `'/hello/'` - Matches only if the path is exactly '/hello/'. There is no special treatment for
 *   trailing slashes, and patterns have to match the entire path, not just a prefix.
 * * `'/user/:id'` - Matches '/user/bob' or '/user/1234!!!' or even '/user/' but not '/user' or
 *   '/user/bob/details'. The second path segment will be captured as the parameter 'id'.
 * * `'/user/{id}'` - Same as the previous example, but using curly brace syntax.
 * * `'/user/{id:[^/]*}'` - Same as the previous example.
 * * `'/user/{id:[0-9a-fA-F]{1,8}}'` - Similar to the previous example, but only matches if the id
 *   parameter consists of 1 to 8 hex digits.
 * * `'/files/{path:.*}'` - Matches any URL starting with '/files/' and captures the rest of the
 *   path into the parameter 'path'.
 * * `'/files/*path'` - ditto.
 * * `'/calendar/{start:date}'` - Matches "/calendar/2014-11-12" (because the pattern defined
 *   in the built-in  `date` Type matches `2014-11-12`) and provides a Date object in $stateParams.start
 *
 * @param {string} pattern  The pattern to compile into a matcher.
 * @param {Object} config  A configuration object hash:
 * @param {Object=} parentMatcher Used to concatenate the pattern/config onto
 *   an existing UrlMatcher
 *
 * * `caseInsensitive` - `true` if URL matching should be case insensitive, otherwise `false`, the default value (for backward compatibility) is `false`.
 * * `strict` - `false` if matching against a URL with a trailing slash should be treated as equivalent to a URL without a trailing slash, the default value is `true`.
 *
 * @property {string} prefix  A static prefix of this pattern. The matcher guarantees that any
 *   URL matching this matcher (i.e. any string for which {@link ui.router.util.type:UrlMatcher#methods_exec exec()} returns
 *   non-null) will start with this prefix.
 *
 * @property {string} source  The pattern that was passed into the constructor
 *
 * @property {string} sourcePath  The path portion of the source property
 *
 * @property {string} sourceSearch  The search portion of the source property
 *
 * @property {string} regex  The constructed regex that will be used to match against the url when
 *   it is time to determine which url will match.
 *
 * @returns {Object}  New `UrlMatcher` object

   *       // name (key) to call the correct service

 * @ngdoc object
 * @name ui.router.state.$stateProvider
 *
 * @requires ui.router.router.$urlRouterProvider
 * @requires ui.router.util.$urlMatcherFactoryProvider
 *
 * @description
 * The new `$stateProvider` works similar to Angular's v1 router, but it focuses purely
 * on state.
 *
 * A state corresponds to a "place" in the application in terms of the overall UI and
 * navigation. A state describes (via the controller / template / view properties) what
 * the UI looks like and does at that place.
 *
 * States often have things in common, and the primary way of factoring out these
 * commonalities in this model is via the state hierarchy, i.e. parent/child states aka
 * nested states.
 *
 * The `$stateProvider` provides interfaces to declare these states for your app.

  /**
   * @ngdoc function
   * @name ui.router.state.$stateProvider#decorator
   * @methodOf ui.router.state.$stateProvider
   *
   * @description
   * Allows you to extend (carefully) or override (at your own peril) the 
   * `stateBuilder` object used internally by `$stateProvider`. This can be used 
   * to add custom functionality to ui-router, for example inferring templateUrl 
   * based on the state name.
   *
   * When passing only a name, it returns the current (original or decorated) builder
   * function that matches `name`.
   *
   * The builder functions that can be decorated are listed below. Though not all
   * necessarily have a good use case for decoration, that is up to you to decide.
   *
   * In addition, users can attach custom decorators, which will generate new 
   * properties within the state's internal definition. There is currently no clear 
   * use-case for this beyond accessing internal states (i.e. $state.$current), 
   * however, expect this to become increasingly relevant as we introduce additional 
   * meta-programming features.
   *
   * **Warning**: Decorators should not be interdependent because the order of 
   * execution of the builder functions in non-deterministic. Builder functions 
   * should only be dependent on the state definition object and super function.
   *
   *
   * Existing builder functions and current return values:
   *
   * - **parent** `{object}` - returns the parent state object.
   * - **data** `{object}` - returns state data, including any inherited data that is not
   *   overridden by own values (if any).
   * - **url** `{object}` - returns a {@link ui.router.util.type:UrlMatcher UrlMatcher}
   *   or `null`.
   * - **navigable** `{object}` - returns closest ancestor state that has a URL (aka is 
   *   navigable).
   * - **params** `{object}` - returns an array of state params that are ensured to 
   *   be a super-set of parent's params.
   * - **views** `{object}` - returns a views object where each key is an absolute view 
   *   name (i.e. "viewName@stateName") and each value is the config object 
   *   (template, controller) for the view. Even when you don't use the views object 
   *   explicitly on a state config, one is still created for you internally.
   *   So by decorating this builder function you have access to decorating template 
   *   and controller properties.
   * - **ownParams** `{object}` - returns an array of params that belong to the state, 
   *   not including any params defined by ancestor states.
   * - **path** `{string}` - returns the full path from the root down to this state. 
   *   Needed for state activation.
   * - **includes** `{object}` - returns an object that includes every state that 
   *   would pass a `$state.includes()` test.
   *
   * @example
   * <pre>
   * // Override the internal 'views' builder with a function that takes the state
   * // definition, and a reference to the internal function being overridden:
   * $stateProvider.decorator('views', function (state, parent) {

   *       views = parent(state);
   *
   *   angular.forEach(views, function (config, name) {
   *     var autoName = (state.name + '.' + name).replace('.', '/');
   *     config.templateUrl = config.templateUrl || '/partials/' + autoName + '.html';
   *     result[name] = config;
   *   });
   *   return result;
   * });
   *
   * $stateProvider.state('home', {
   *   views: {
   *     'contact.list': { controller: 'ListController' },
   *     'contact.item': { controller: 'ItemController' }
   *   }
   * });
   *
   * // ...
   *
   * $state.go('home');
   * // Auto-populates list and item views with /partials/home/contact/list.html,

   * Arbitrary data object, useful for custom configuration.  The parent state's `data` is
   *   prototypally inherited.  In other words, adding a data property to a state adds it to
   *   the entire subtree via prototypal inheritance.
   *
   * <pre>data: {
   *     requiredRole: 'foo'
   * } </pre>
   *
   * @param {object=} stateConfig.params
   * <a id='params'></a>
   *
   * A map which optionally configures parameters declared in the `url`, or
   *   defines additional non-url parameters.  For each parameter being
   *   configured, add a configuration object keyed to the name of the parameter.
   *
   *   Each parameter configuration object may contain the following properties:
   *
   *   - ** value ** - {object|function=}: specifies the default value for this
   *     parameter.  This implicitly sets this parameter as optional.
   *
   *     When UI-Router routes to a state and no value is
   *     specified for this parameter in the URL or transition, the
   *     default value will be used instead.  If `value` is a function,
   *     it will be injected and invoked, and the return value used.
   *
   *     *Note*: `undefined` is treated as "no default value" while `null`
   *     is treated as "the default value is `null`".
   *
   *     *Shorthand*: If you only need to configure the default value of the
   *     parameter, you may use a shorthand syntax.   In the **`params`**
   *     map, instead mapping the param name to a full parameter configuration
   *     object, simply set map it to the default parameter value, e.g.:
   *
   * <pre>// define a parameter's default value
   * params: {
   *     param1: { value: "defaultValue" }
   * }
   * // shorthand default values
   * params: {
   *     param1: "defaultValue",
   *     param2: "param2Default"
   * }</pre>
   *
   *   - ** array ** - {boolean=}: *(default: false)* If true, the param value will be
   *     treated as an array of values.  If you specified a Type, the value will be
   *     treated as an array of the specified Type.  Note: query parameter values
   *     default to a special `"auto"` mode.
   *
   *     For query parameters in `"auto"` mode, if multiple  values for a single parameter
   *     are present in the URL (e.g.: `/foo?bar=1&bar=2&bar=3`) then the values
   *     are mapped to an array (e.g.: `{ foo: [ '1', '2', '3' ] }`).  However, if
   *     only one value is present (e.g.: `/foo?bar=1`) then the value is treated as single
   *     value (e.g.: `{ foo: '1' }`).
   *
   * <pre>params: {
   *     param1: { array: true }
   * }</pre>
   *
   *   - ** squash ** - {bool|string=}: `squash` configures how a default parameter value is represented in the URL when
   *     the current parameter value is the same as the default value. If `squash` is not set, it uses the
   *     configured default squash policy.
   *     (See {@link ui.router.util.$urlMatcherFactory#methods_defaultSquashPolicy `defaultSquashPolicy()`})
   *
   *   There are three squash settings:
   *
   *     - false: The parameter's default value is not squashed.  It is encoded and included in the URL
   *     - true: The parameter's default value is omitted from the URL.  If the parameter is preceeded and followed
   *       by slashes in the state's `url` declaration, then one of those slashes are omitted.
   *       This can allow for cleaner looking URLs.
   *     - `"<arbitrary string>"`: The parameter's default value is replaced with an arbitrary placeholder of  your choice.
   *
   * <pre>params: {
   *     param1: {
   *       value: "defaultId",
   *       squash: true
   * } }
   * // squash "defaultValue" to "~"
   * params: {
   *     param1: {
   *       value: "defaultValue",
   *       squash: "~"
   * } }
   * </pre>
   *
   *
   * @example
   * <pre>
   * // Some state name examples
   *
   * // stateName can be a single top-level name (must be unique).
   * $stateProvider.state("home", {});
   *
   * // Or it can be a nested state name. This state is a child of the
   * // above "home" state.
   * $stateProvider.state("home.newest", {});
   *
   * // Nest states as deeply as needed.
   * $stateProvider.state("home.newest.abc.xyz.inception", {});
   *
   * // state() returns $stateProvider, so you can chain state declarations.

     *
     * @description
     * Convenience method for transitioning to a new state. `$state.go` calls 
     * `$state.transitionTo` internally but automatically sets options to 
     * `{ location: true, inherit: true, relative: $state.$current, notify: true }`. 
     * This allows you to easily use an absolute or relative to path and specify 
     * only the parameters you'd like to update (while letting unspecified parameters 
     * inherit from the currently active ancestor states).
     *
     * @example
     * <pre>
     * var app = angular.module('app', ['ui.router']);
     *
     * app.controller('ctrl', function ($scope, $state) {
     *   $scope.changeState = function () {
     *     $state.go('contact.detail');
     *   };

     * </pre>
     * <img src='../ngdoc_assets/StateGoExamples.png'/>
     *
     * @param {string} to Absolute state name or relative state path. Some examples:
     *
     * - `$state.go('contact.detail')` - will go to the `contact.detail` state
     * - `$state.go('^')` - will go to a parent state
     * - `$state.go('^.sibling')` - will go to a sibling state
     * - `$state.go('.child.grandchild')` - will go to grandchild state
     *
     * @param {object=} params A map of the parameters that will be sent to the state, 
     * will populate $stateParams. Any parameters that are not specified will be inherited from currently 
     * defined parameters. Only parameters specified in the state definition can be overridden, new 
     * parameters will be ignored. This allows, for example, going to a sibling state that shares parameters
     * specified in a parent state. Parameter inheritance only works between common ancestor states, I.e.
     * transitioning to a sibling will get you the parameters for all parents, transitioning to a child
     * will get you all current parameters, etc.
     * @param {object=} options Options object. The options are:
     *
     * - **`location`** - {boolean=true|string=} - If `true` will update the url in the location bar, if `false`
     *    will not. If string, must be `"replace"`, which will update url and also replace last history record.
     * - **`inherit`** - {boolean=true}, If `true` will inherit url parameters from current url.
     * - **`relative`** - {object=$state.$current}, When transitioning with relative path (e.g '^'), 
     *    defines which state to be relative from.
     * - **`notify`** - {boolean=true}, If `true` will broadcast $stateChangeStart and $stateChangeSuccess events.
     * - **`reload`** (v0.2.5) - {boolean=false|string|object}, If `true` will force transition even if no state or params
     *    have changed.  It will reload the resolves and views of the current state and parent states.
     *    If `reload` is a string (or state object), the state object is fetched (by name, or object reference); and \
     *    the transition reloads the resolves and views for that matched state, and all its children states.
     *
     * @returns {promise} A promise representing the state of the new transition.
     *
     * Possible success values:
     *
     * - $state.current
     *
     * <br/>Possible rejection values:
     *
     * - 'transition superseded' - when a newer transition has been started after this one
     * - 'transition prevented' - when `event.preventDefault()` has been called in a `$stateChangeStart` listener
     * - 'transition aborted' - when `event.preventDefault()` has been called in a `$stateNotFound` listener or
     *   when a `$stateNotFound` `event.retry` promise errors.
     * - 'transition failed' - when a state has been unsuccessfully found after 2 tries.
     * - *resolve error* - when an error has occurred with a `resolve`

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ui.router.state.directive:ui-view
 *
 * @requires ui.router.state.$state
 * @requires $compile
 * @requires $controller
 * @requires $injector
 * @requires ui.router.state.$uiViewScroll
 * @requires $document
 *
 * @restrict ECA
 *
 * @description
 * The ui-view directive tells $state where to place your templates.
 *
 * @param {string=} name A view name. The name should be unique amongst the other views in the
 * same state. You can have views of the same name that live in different states.
 *
 * @param {string=} autoscroll It allows you to set the scroll behavior of the browser window
 * when a view is populated. By default, $anchorScroll is overridden by ui-router's custom scroll
 * service, {@link ui.router.state.$uiViewScroll}. This custom service let's you
 * scroll ui-view elements into view when they are populated during a state activation.
 *
 * *Note: To revert back to old [`$anchorScroll`](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.$anchorScroll)
 * functionality, call `$uiViewScrollProvider.useAnchorScroll()`.*
 *
 * @param {string=} onload Expression to evaluate whenever the view updates.
 *
 * @example
 * A view can be unnamed or named.
 * <pre>
 * <!-- Unnamed -->
 * <div ui-view></div>
 *
 * <!-- Named -->
 * <div ui-view="viewName"></div>
 * </pre>
 *
 * You can only have one unnamed view within any template (or root html). If you are only using a
 * single view and it is unnamed then you can populate it like so:
 * <pre>
 * <div ui-view></div>
 * $stateProvider.state("home", {
 *   template: "<h1>HELLO!</h1>"
 * })
 * </pre>
 *
 * The above is a convenient shortcut equivalent to specifying your view explicitly with the {@link ui.router.state.$stateProvider#methods_state `views`}
 * config property, by name, in this case an empty name:
 * <pre>
 * $stateProvider.state("home", {
 *   views: {
 *     "": {
 *       template: "<h1>HELLO!</h1>"
 *     }
 *   }    
 * })
 * </pre>
 *
 * But typically you'll only use the views property if you name your view or have more than one view
 * in the same template. There's not really a compelling reason to name a view if its the only one,
 * but you could if you wanted, like so:
 * <pre>
 * <div ui-view="main"></div>
 * </pre>
 * <pre>
 * $stateProvider.state("home", {
 *   views: {
 *     "main": {
 *       template: "<h1>HELLO!</h1>"
 *     }
 *   }    
 * })
 * </pre>
 *
 * Really though, you'll use views to set up multiple views:
 * <pre>
 * <div ui-view></div>
 * <div ui-view="chart"></div>
 * <div ui-view="data"></div>
 * </pre>
 *
 * <pre>
 * $stateProvider.state("home", {
 *   views: {
 *     "": {
 *       template: "<h1>HELLO!</h1>"
 *     },
 *     "chart": {
 *       template: "<chart_thing/>"
 *     },
 *     "data": {
 *       template: "<data_thing/>"
 *     }
 *   }    
 * })
 * </pre>
 *
 * Examples for `autoscroll`:
 *
 * <pre>
 * <!-- If autoscroll present with no expression,
 *      then scroll ui-view into view -->
 * <ui-view autoscroll/>
 *
 * <!-- If autoscroll present with valid expression,
 *      then scroll ui-view into view if expression evaluates to true -->
 * <ui-view autoscroll='true'/>
 * <ui-view autoscroll='false'/>
 * <ui-view autoscroll='scopeVariable'/>
 * </pre>
 *
 * Resolve data:
 *
 * The resolved data from the state's `resolve` block is placed on the scope as `$resolve` (this
 * can be customized using [[ViewDeclaration.resolveAs]]).  This can be then accessed from the template.
 *
 * Note that when `controllerAs` is being used, `$resolve` is set on the controller instance *after* the
 * controller is instantiated.  The `$onInit()` hook can be used to perform initialization code which
 * depends on `$resolve` data.
 *
 * Example usage of $resolve in a view template
 * <pre>
 * $stateProvider.state('home', {
 *   template: '<my-component user="$resolve.user"></my-component>',
 *   resolve: {
 *     user: function(UserService) { return UserService.fetchUser(); }
 *   }
 * });
 * </pre>

 *
 * @description
 * A directive that binds a link (`<a>` tag) to a state. If the state has an associated
 * URL, the directive will automatically generate & update the `href` attribute via
 * the {@link ui.router.state.$state#methods_href $state.href()} method. Clicking
 * the link will trigger a state transition with optional parameters.
 *
 * Also middle-clicking, right-clicking, and ctrl-clicking on the link will be
 * handled natively by the browser.
 *
 * You can also use relative state paths within ui-sref, just like the relative
 * paths passed to `$state.go()`. You just need to be aware that the path is relative
 * to the state that the link lives in, in other words the state that loaded the
 * template containing the link.
 *
 * You can specify options to pass to {@link ui.router.state.$state#methods_go $state.go()}
 * using the `ui-sref-opts` attribute. Options are restricted to `location`, `inherit`,
 * and `reload`.
 *
 * @example
 * Here's an example of how you'd use ui-sref and how it would compile. If you have the
 * following template:
 * <pre>
 * <a ui-sref="home">Home</a> | <a ui-sref="about">About</a> | <a ui-sref="{page: 2}">Next page</a>
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li ng-repeat="contact in contacts">
 *         <a ui-sref="contacts.detail({ id: contact.id })">{{ contact.name }}</a>
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
 * </pre>
 *
 * Then the compiled html would be (assuming Html5Mode is off and current state is contacts):
 * <pre>
 * <a href="#/home" ui-sref="home">Home</a> | <a href="#/about" ui-sref="about">About</a> | <a href="#/contacts?page=2" ui-sref="{page: 2}">Next page</a>
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li ng-repeat="contact in contacts">
 *         <a href="#/contacts/1" ui-sref="contacts.detail({ id: contact.id })">Joe</a>
 *     </li>
 *     <li ng-repeat="contact in contacts">
 *         <a href="#/contacts/2" ui-sref="contacts.detail({ id: contact.id })">Alice</a>
 *     </li>
 *     <li ng-repeat="contact in contacts">
 *         <a href="#/contacts/3" ui-sref="contacts.detail({ id: contact.id })">Bob</a>
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <a ui-sref="home" ui-sref-opts="{reload: true}">Home</a>
 * </pre>

 * @name ui.router.state.directive:ui-sref-active
 *
 * @requires ui.router.state.$state
 * @requires ui.router.state.$stateParams
 * @requires $interpolate
 *
 * @restrict A
 *
 * @description
 * A directive working alongside ui-sref to add classes to an element when the
 * related ui-sref directive's state is active, and removing them when it is inactive.
 * The primary use-case is to simplify the special appearance of navigation menus
 * relying on `ui-sref`, by having the "active" state's menu button appear different,
 * distinguishing it from the inactive menu items.
 *
 * ui-sref-active can live on the same element as ui-sref or on a parent element. The first
 * ui-sref-active found at the same level or above the ui-sref will be used.
 *
 * Will activate when the ui-sref's target state or any child state is active. If you
 * need to activate only when the ui-sref target state is active and *not* any of
 * it's children, then you will use
 * {@link ui.router.state.directive:ui-sref-active-eq ui-sref-active-eq}
 *
 * @example
 * Given the following template:
 * <pre>
 * <ul>
 *   <li ui-sref-active="active" class="item">
 *     <a href ui-sref="app.user({user: 'bilbobaggins'})">@bilbobaggins</a>
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
 * </pre>
 *
 *
 * When the app state is "app.user" (or any children states), and contains the state parameter "user" with value "bilbobaggins",
 * the resulting HTML will appear as (note the 'active' class):
 * <pre>
 * <ul>
 *   <li ui-sref-active="active" class="item active">
 *     <a ui-sref="app.user({user: 'bilbobaggins'})" href="/users/bilbobaggins">@bilbobaggins</a>
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
 * </pre>
 *
 * The class name is interpolated **once** during the directives link time (any further changes to the
 * interpolated value are ignored).
 *
 * Multiple classes may be specified in a space-separated format:
 * <pre>
 * <ul>
 *   <li ui-sref-active='class1 class2 class3'>
 *     <a ui-sref="app.user">link</a>
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
 * </pre>
 *
 * It is also possible to pass ui-sref-active an expression that evaluates
 * to an object hash, whose keys represent active class names and whose
 * values represent the respective state names/globs.
 * ui-sref-active will match if the current active state **includes** any of
 * the specified state names/globs, even the abstract ones.
 *
 * @Example
 * Given the following template, with "admin" being an abstract state:
 * <pre>
 * <div ui-sref-active="{'active': 'admin.*'}">
 *   <a ui-sref-active="active" ui-sref="admin.roles">Roles</a>
 * </div>
 * </pre>
 *
 * When the current state is "admin.roles" the "active" class will be applied
 * to both the <div> and <a> elements. It is important to note that the state
 * names/globs passed to ui-sref-active shadow the state provided by ui-sref.
