  /**
   * Use the dnd-draggable attribute to make your element draggable
   *
   * Attributes:
   * - dnd-draggable      Required attribute. The value has to be an object that represents the data
   *                      of the element. In case of a drag and drop operation the object will be
   *                      serialized and unserialized on the receiving end.
   * - dnd-effect-allowed Use this attribute to limit the operations that can be performed. Valid
   *                      options are "move", "copy" and "link", as well as "all", "copyMove",
   *                      "copyLink" and "linkMove". The semantics of these operations are up to you
   *                      and have to be implemented using the callbacks described below. If you
   *                      allow multiple options, the user can choose between them by using the
   *                      modifier keys (OS specific). The cursor will be changed accordingly,
   *                      expect for IE and Edge, where this is not supported.
   * - dnd-type           Use this attribute if you have different kinds of items in your
   *                      application and you want to limit which items can be dropped into which
   *                      lists. Combine with dnd-allowed-types on the dnd-list(s). This attribute
   *                      must be a lower case string. Upper case characters can be used, but will
   *                      be converted to lower case automatically.
   * - dnd-disable-if     You can use this attribute to dynamically disable the draggability of the
   *                      element. This is useful if you have certain list items that you don't want
   *                      to be draggable, or if you want to disable drag & drop completely without
   *                      having two different code branches (e.g. only allow for admins).
   *
   * Callbacks:
   * - dnd-dragstart      Callback that is invoked when the element was dragged. The original
   *                      dragstart event will be provided in the local event variable.
   * - dnd-moved          Callback that is invoked when the element was moved. Usually you will
   *                      remove your element from the original list in this callback, since the
   *                      directive is not doing that for you automatically. The original dragend
   *                      event will be provided in the local event variable.
   * - dnd-copied         Same as dnd-moved, just that it is called when the element was copied
   *                      instead of moved, so you probably want to implement a different logic.
   * - dnd-linked         Same as dnd-moved, just that it is called when the element was linked
   *                      instead of moved, so you probably want to implement a different logic.
   * - dnd-canceled       Callback that is invoked if the element was dragged, but the operation was
   *                      canceled and the element was not dropped. The original dragend event will
   *                      be provided in the local event variable.
   * - dnd-dragend        Callback that is invoked when the drag operation ended. Available local
   *                      variables are event and dropEffect.
   * - dnd-selected       Callback that is invoked when the element was clicked but not dragged.
   *                      The original click event will be provided in the local event variable.
   * - dnd-callback       Custom callback that is passed to dropzone callbacks and can be used to
   *                      communicate between source and target scopes. The dropzone can pass user
   *                      defined variables to this callback.
   *
   * CSS classes:
   * - dndDragging        This class will be added to the element while the element is being
   *                      dragged. It will affect both the element you see while dragging and the
   *                      source element that stays at it's position. Do not try to hide the source
   *                      element with this class, because that will abort the drag operation.
   * - dndDraggingSource  This class will be added to the element after the drag operation was
   *                      started, meaning it only affects the original element that is still at
   *                      it's source position, and not the "element" that the user is dragging with
   *                      his mouse pointer.

  /**
   * Use the dnd-list attribute to make your list element a dropzone. Usually you will add a single
   * li element as child with the ng-repeat directive. If you don't do that, we will not be able to
   * position the dropped element correctly. If you want your list to be sortable, also add the
   * dnd-draggable directive to your li element(s).
   *
   * Attributes:
   * - dnd-list             Required attribute. The value has to be the array in which the data of
   *                        the dropped element should be inserted. The value can be blank if used
   *                        with a custom dnd-drop handler that always returns true.
   * - dnd-allowed-types    Optional array of allowed item types. When used, only items that had a
   *                        matching dnd-type attribute will be dropable. Upper case characters will
   *                        automatically be converted to lower case.
   * - dnd-effect-allowed   Optional string expression that limits the drop effects that can be
   *                        performed in the list. See dnd-effect-allowed on dnd-draggable for more
   *                        details on allowed options. The default value is all.
   * - dnd-disable-if       Optional boolean expresssion. When it evaluates to true, no dropping
   *                        into the list is possible. Note that this also disables rearranging
   *                        items inside the list.
   * - dnd-horizontal-list  Optional boolean expresssion. When it evaluates to true, the positioning
   *                        algorithm will use the left and right halfs of the list items instead of
   *                        the upper and lower halfs.
   * - dnd-external-sources Optional boolean expression. When it evaluates to true, the list accepts
   *                        drops from sources outside of the current browser tab. This allows to
   *                        drag and drop accross different browser tabs. The only major browser
   *                        that does not support this is currently Microsoft Edge.
   *
   * Callbacks:
   * - dnd-dragover         Optional expression that is invoked when an element is dragged over the
   *                        list. If the expression is set, but does not return true, the element is
   *                        not allowed to be dropped. The following variables will be available:
   *                        - event: The original dragover event sent by the browser.
   *                        - index: The position in the list at which the element would be dropped.
   *                        - type: The dnd-type set on the dnd-draggable, or undefined if non was
   *                          set. Will be null for drops from external sources in IE and Edge,
   *                          since we don't know the type in those cases.
   *                        - dropEffect: One of move, copy or link, see dnd-effect-allowed.
   *                        - external: Whether the element was dragged from an external source.
   *                        - callback: If dnd-callback was set on the source element, this is a
   *                          function reference to the callback. The callback can be invoked with
   *                          custom variables like this: callback({var1: value1, var2: value2}).
   *                          The callback will be executed on the scope of the source element. If
   *                          dnd-external-sources was set and external is true, this callback will
   *                          not be available.
   * - dnd-drop             Optional expression that is invoked when an element is dropped on the
   *                        list. The same variables as for dnd-dragover will be available, with the
   *                        exception that type is always known and therefore never null. There
   *                        will also be an item variable, which is the transferred object. The
   *                        return value determines the further handling of the drop:
   *                        - falsy: The drop will be canceled and the element won't be inserted.
   *                        - true: Signalises that the drop is allowed, but the dnd-drop
   *                          callback already took care of inserting the element.
   *                        - otherwise: All other return values will be treated as the object to
   *                          insert into the array. In most cases you want to simply return the
   *                          item parameter, but there are no restrictions on what you can return.
   * - dnd-inserted         Optional expression that is invoked after a drop if the element was
   *                        actually inserted into the list. The same local variables as for
   *                        dnd-drop will be available. Note that for reorderings inside the same
   *                        list the old element will still be in the list due to the fact that
   *                        dnd-moved was not called yet.
   *
   * CSS classes:
   * - dndPlaceholder       When an element is dragged over the list, a new placeholder child
   *                        element will be added. This element is of type li and has the class
   *                        dndPlaceholder set. Alternatively, you can define your own placeholder
   *                        by creating a child element with dndPlaceholder class.
   * - dndDragover          Will be added to the list while an element is dragged over the list.

 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name tagsInput
 * @module ngTagsInput
 *
 * @description
 * Renders an input box with tag editing support.
 *
 * @param {string} ngModel Assignable Angular expression to data-bind to.
 * @param {string=} [template=NA] URL or id of a custom template for rendering each tag.
 * @param {string=} [templateScope=NA] Scope to be passed to custom templates - of both tagsInput and
 *    autoComplete directives - as $scope.
 * @param {string=} [displayProperty=text] Property to be rendered as the tag label.
 * @param {string=} [keyProperty=text] Property to be used as a unique identifier for the tag.
 * @param {string=} [type=text] Type of the input element. Only 'text', 'email' and 'url' are supported values.
 * @param {string=} [text=NA] Assignable Angular expression for data-binding to the element's text.
 * @param {number=} tabindex Tab order of the control.
 * @param {string=} [placeholder=Add a tag] Placeholder text for the control.
 * @param {number=} [minLength=3] Minimum length for a new tag.
 * @param {number=} [maxLength=MAX_SAFE_INTEGER] Maximum length allowed for a new tag.
 * @param {number=} [minTags=0] Sets minTags validation error key if the number of tags added is less than minTags.
 * @param {number=} [maxTags=MAX_SAFE_INTEGER] Sets maxTags validation error key if the number of tags added is greater
 *    than maxTags.
 * @param {boolean=} [allowLeftoverText=false] Sets leftoverText validation error key if there is any leftover text in
 *    the input element when the directive loses focus.
 * @param {string=} [removeTagSymbol=×] (Obsolete) Symbol character for the remove tag button.
 * @param {boolean=} [addOnEnter=true] Flag indicating that a new tag will be added on pressing the ENTER key.
 * @param {boolean=} [addOnSpace=false] Flag indicating that a new tag will be added on pressing the SPACE key.
 * @param {boolean=} [addOnComma=true] Flag indicating that a new tag will be added on pressing the COMMA key.
 * @param {boolean=} [addOnBlur=true] Flag indicating that a new tag will be added when the input field loses focus.
 * @param {boolean=} [addOnPaste=false] Flag indicating that the text pasted into the input field will be split into tags.
 * @param {string=} [pasteSplitPattern=,] Regular expression used to split the pasted text into tags.
 * @param {boolean=} [replaceSpacesWithDashes=true] Flag indicating that spaces will be replaced with dashes.
 * @param {string=} [allowedTagsPattern=.+] Regular expression that determines whether a new tag is valid.
 * @param {boolean=} [enableEditingLastTag=false] Flag indicating that the last tag will be moved back into the new tag
 *    input box instead of being removed when the backspace key is pressed and the input box is empty.
 * @param {boolean=} [addFromAutocompleteOnly=false] Flag indicating that only tags coming from the autocomplete list
 *    will be allowed. When this flag is true, addOnEnter, addOnComma, addOnSpace and addOnBlur values are ignored.
 * @param {boolean=} [spellcheck=true] Flag indicating whether the browser's spellcheck is enabled for the input field or not.
 * @param {expression=} [tagClass=NA] Expression to evaluate for each existing tag in order to get the CSS classes to be used.
 *    The expression is provided with the current tag as $tag, its index as $index and its state as $selected. The result
 *    of the evaluation must be one of the values supported by the ngClass directive (either a string, an array or an object).
 *    See https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngClass for more information.
 * @param {expression=} [onTagAdding=NA] Expression to evaluate that will be invoked before adding a new tag. The new
 *    tag is available as $tag. This method must return either a boolean value or a promise. If either a false value or a rejected
 *    promise is returned, the tag will not be added.
 * @param {expression=} [onTagAdded=NA] Expression to evaluate upon adding a new tag. The new tag is available as $tag.
 * @param {expression=} [onInvalidTag=NA] Expression to evaluate when a tag is invalid. The invalid tag is available as $tag.
 * @param {expression=} [onTagRemoving=NA] Expression to evaluate that will be invoked before removing a tag. The tag
 *    is available as $tag. This method must return either a boolean value or a promise. If either a false value or a rejected
 *    promise is returned, the tag will not be removed.
 * @param {expression=} [onTagRemoved=NA] Expression to evaluate upon removing an existing tag. The removed tag is available as $tag.
 * @param {expression=} [onTagClicked=NA] Expression to evaluate upon clicking an existing tag. The clicked tag is available as $tag.

 * @param {number=} [minLength=3] Minimum number of characters that must be entered before evaluating the expression
 *    in the source option.
 * @param {boolean=} [highlightMatchedText=true] Flag indicating that the matched text will be highlighted in the
 *    suggestions list.
 * @param {number=} [maxResultsToShow=10] Maximum number of results to be displayed at a time.
 * @param {boolean=} [loadOnDownArrow=false] Flag indicating that the source option will be evaluated when the down arrow
 *    key is pressed and the suggestion list is closed. The current input value is available as $query.
 * @param {boolean=} [loadOnEmpty=false] Flag indicating that the source option will be evaluated when the input content
 *    becomes empty. The $query variable will be passed to the expression as an empty string.
 * @param {boolean=} [loadOnFocus=false] Flag indicating that the source option will be evaluated when the input element
